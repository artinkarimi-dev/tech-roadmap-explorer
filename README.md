## 📖 Overview

**Tech Roadmap Explorer** is a highly interactive roadmap application that helps learners navigate through key domains in software development: **Frontend, Backend, Security, AI, and DevOps**.

Users can **select a domain** and instantly see a **step-by-step roadmap**: what to learn first, what comes next, and the difficulty level for each skill:

- ✅ **Green** = Simple
- ⚠️ **Yellow** = Moderate
- ❌ **Red** = Difficult

> This project is fully **responsive**, uses **modern styling** via Tailwind CSS, and features **real-world roadmap data** from credible sources.

## ✨ Key Features

- **Dynamic Domain Selection:** Choose your domain and instantly populate a roadmap table.
- **Difficulty Indicators:** Clear visual cues for each skill's complexity.
- **Component-Based Architecture:** All UI elements (Title, Selector, Table, Navigation) are modular and reusable.
- **Responsive Design:** Fully mobile-friendly, with hover effects and smooth transitions.
- **Realistic Roadmap:** Skills and learning order based on authentic developer roadmaps.
- **Accessible UI:** Built using Radix UI components for keyboard navigation and screen reader compatibility.
